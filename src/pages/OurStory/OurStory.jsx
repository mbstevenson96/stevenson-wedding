          Your typical love story doesn’t usually start in the home of your ex-boyfriend…. but Corey’s and Anna’s does. In 2020 Corey and Anna met at a young adult’s group in Bartlett, TN for a church neither of them really attended.  It was game over from there.  Corey saw Anna from across the room and couldn’t help but talk to her first! Little did Corey know that all of Anna’s friends had called “dibs”, but turns out their dibs don’t mean shit!  Corey and Anna went on their first date not too long after and kept it going.  They both fell in love with each other’s lives and wanted to support each other in every way.  There were dates that were fun and careless, and ones that were more serious.  They both valued and loved each moment none the less.  As time went on, they realized they were meant for each other in every way. They shared many moments from volunteer events at church and Veteran services, to awesome “biker shit”, and learning the different dynamics of each other’s lives and loving it all.

          In August of 2022 Corey proposed in the backyard of his childhood home in Circleville, Ohio.  Corey and Anna have always admired the small town feel and life, so what better place to ask the best woman to marry him than the home he was raised in.  Our friends joined in to make it  an eventful and meaningful experience by making the nine-hour secret drive up, staying in local places, and being there after he asked the question.  In true fashion to Corey, he wanted everyone there for it, but Anna is like a bloodhound with surprises and figuring things out so Corey had to make the hard choice and keep it small.  Corey’s mother, sister, and grandmother helped pull a successful distraction so Corey could prepare the house with his friends, family, great bourbon, and of course…“biker shit.”  When Anna came home, Corey’s father gave the lie that Corey was working on the mower and it wasn’t going well (which usually isn’t a lie, and an experience she knows all too well).  When Anna came down to the barn Corey and his best man, Evan Debo, walked out together.  Evan stuck behind as Anna and Corey walked ahead since she genuinely thought Corey was mad with the mower.  As they approached the house, Anna had a picture book she spent a month making with a picture from each month they had been dating.  They had talked about what to put for August so Corey pulled out the book, got down on one knee, and said “I know what picture we need to put in this book… Anna Grace Steeley …will you marry me?” Anna was very shocked, actually passed out for half a second, and finally said yes after much excitement!

          Now let’s fast forward to September 15th, 2022.  Corey and Anna knew they would be together forever, so why wait?  Also, for you military folk who know, BAH and Tri-Care helps! They got married at Spitfires Bar and Grill in Brighton, TN.  This was the home to Corey’s life in the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association (CVMA), a family for Anna she came to love, the foundation to many great friends they have today, and the means to him coming full circle as a Marine by getting married in a bar. This was supposed to be a small and quick event, as Corey had to return to school the next day, but bikers can’t do anything small.  They did what bikers and family do and went all out!  Corey and Anna’s immediate family made the journey as well to make it even more special.  Corey’s father helped his best friend in TN, Alex Provonsha, write the short vows (more in-depth ones to come) so we could be a couple!  Turns out in the state of TN, it doesn’t take much to make Alex Provonsha the infamous “Reverend Alex Provonsha.”  They could not have asked for a better biker bar marriage experience than that. Such a small thing for them quickly became a very memorable event.   They could not have had any of this if it wasn’t for the bar owner, Vickie Coone, keeping ownership of the bar for four more days so they could have this experience!

          Corey and Anna have started their lives together in Fort Walton Beach, FL with him being stationed at Eglin Air Force Base.  They are loving the area, beach, and finally being together after a quick bar marriage, the struggle of training, and moving from three states.  None of this could have been, or will be possible, without the loving support of their friends and family across many states who will always be there!
